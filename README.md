Wine Quality Prediction

Introduction to project:
Wine is an alcoholic drink made from fermented grapes. [1]  Yeast consumes the sugar in the
grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide, and heat. Different varieties of grapes and
strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. Wine is categorised based on quality and
price is set accordingly. These days all types of industries are improving by adopting new
technologies and applying them in all areas to enhance the production. But still some areas
need human expertise such as quality assurance. This process becomes expensive over the
demand of product. To automate this process in area of wine there is need of an application.

Solution:
An application is built that rates the quality of wine in a range of 1 – 5. The quality of wine
can be predicted considering the factors like volatile and fixed acidity, citric acid added, total
sulphur dioxide present pH, sulphates etc. This enables users (farmers and people making
wine) to maintain the levels of products added to get good quality of wine.
